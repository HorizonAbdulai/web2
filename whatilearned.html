<div class="how">
<pre>1. One thing I learned in this class is obviously, how to make a webpage.
    Although I am not as good at it as I want to be, it truly is something that
    is fun and gets my brain moving.

<div class="div">
<pre>2. Another thing I learned in this class which is probably one of my favorites,
    is the Div tag, this tag is honestly a life saver. It makes everything a whole
    lot easier. It's a tag that I recommend everyone use as it's helpful to you and
    makes work flow much smoother.
</pre>

</div>
  <div class="margin">
<pre>3. Although the Div tag is a very useful tag, the margin tag honestly just blows
    it out the window. The Margin tag is something that makes everything easier with its
    versatility etc.
